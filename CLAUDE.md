# INFOST 582 Final Project Requirements

## Assignment Overview

- **Task**: Select a question/topic, gather data (or use existing dataset), clean it, analyze it, and present results in a professional report
- **Word count**: 1500 words minimum for graduate students (800 for undergrad)

### Graphs/Charts/Tables
- Must be readable size
- Must have numbered captions
- Must be referenced in text
- Axes must be labeled
- Each must have minimum one sentence explaining why it's included

### Writing Style
- Professional report format (not essay)
